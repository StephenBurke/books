Flow Control and Loops
Flow Control
	if and else
	r{
		if(TRUE) message("It was true!")
		if(FLASE) message("It wan't true!")
	}
	missing values aren't allowed to be passed to if; doing so throws an error
	r{
		if (NA) message("Who knows if it was true?")
	}
	where you may have a missing value, you should test for it using is.na
	r{
		if(is.na(NA)) message("The value is missing!")
	}
	In this next example runif(1) generates one uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1. If that value is more than 0.5, then the message is displayed
	r{
		if(tunif(1)>0.5) message("This message appears with a 50% chance.")
	}
	If you want to conditionally execute several statements, you can wrap them in curly braces
	r{
		x <- 3
		if(x > 2)
		{
			y <- 2 * x
			z <- 3 * y
		}
	}
	if else example
	r{
		if(FALSE)
		{
			message("This won't execute...")
		} else
		{
			message("but this will.")
		}
	}
	**the else statement must occur on the same line as teh closing curl race from the if clause. If you move it to the next line you'll get an error
	else if statements
	r{

	}
